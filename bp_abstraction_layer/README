The library bp_abstraction_layer was created to provide a middle layer 
between the Bundle Protocol implementation and the application.
It was created to permit the dtnperf_3 application to run in the same 
way on DTN2 an on ION, but I think that it can be useful to every application
that want to run indipendently of the running BP implementation.

The library at runtime gets the BP implementation running on the node and
it interfaces with the BP calling the right API.

Actually it was implemented only the DTN2 support, but the ION support should
be implemented in the next few months.


         ---------------        COMPILE         ---------------
         
To compile the library it is provided a script file compile.sh
To compile it is necessary to tell the compiler where are the headers of
the DTN2 or ION code, or both.

---- Compile with DTN2 support

Simply do the following command:

$ sh compile.sh DTN2 /path/to/DTN2/headers/

The first argument tells the script that you are compiling for DTN2 support.
The second argument tells the compiler where to find the DTN2 headers.
In the most cases header of DTN2 are in the source directory of DTN2.

Make sure to do

$./configure

in the DTN2 source code directory and in the oasys one to generate the headers.

If the compiler throws errors regarding the file "oasys-config.h", make a
symbolic link to the file oasys-src/oasys-config.h in the dir DTN2-src/oasys/

Example:
$ ls 
	oasys-src DTN2-src
	
$ cd oasys-src

$ ./configure

$ cd ../DTN2-src

$ ./configure

$ cd oasys

$ ln -s ../../oasys-src/oasys-config.h


-------- Compile with ION support

TO BE DEFINED

-------- Compile with both DTN2 and ION support

TO BE DEFINED



         ---------------         INSTALL        ---------------

To install the library in the system simply do the following command with 
root privileges:

# install libbp_abstraction_layer.so -m 644 /usr/lib/

or / and

# install libbp_abstraction_layer.a -m 644 /usr/lib/
